      or guanciale, and black pepper.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>4 slices bacon (or guanciale for authentic version)</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to
        package instructions; reserve ½ cup of pasta water, then drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and Parmesan until smooth; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook bacon until crispy, about 6–8
        minutes. Remove excess fat, leaving about 1 tablespoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic to the skillet and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        Reduce heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly add the drained pasta to the skillet. Pour in the egg-Parmesan
        mixture, tossing continuously to coat the pasta without scrambling the
        eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until the sauce
        reaches a creamy consistency.
      </li>
      <li>Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, garnished with parsley and extra Parmesan if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
